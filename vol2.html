                          Welcome back to That's What She Said! It's been a long summer. Everything from women's healthcare and DREAMers' statuses being threatened to Charlottesville erupting in white supremacy and violence flooded our news feeds these past few months. This means that now more than ever it is crucial that everyone remains active in the resistance against hatred and bigotry. Luckily, we are here to help! Every article and video in this (and every) issue has been hand-picked in the hopes that it will allow you to stay awake, expand your knowledge, and develop your views and opinions. In addition, Athena Chu writes about the exploitation of Chinese women in America in her poem "How We Are Made" and Max Ambris discusses the dangers of toxic masculinity in his article accompanied by artwork from Lucy Lyman.

                      <p>
                          One of my favorite TV series ever is Friends. I've binge-watched it a few times, and though I can't resist coming back to it when I'm bored, I cringe nearly every episode. I do so because there's always a major issue in the show that is still prevalent today: gender roles, specifically for guys. I want to preface this by saying that I don't want guys to feel targeted. I truly believe that no one at BB&amp;N behaves in these ways out of malice; I really think it's just that some people may not fully realize the impact of their words. People hear the terms "gender roles" and "toxic masculinity", and they roll their eyes. They think it's just a bunch of softies trying to be politically correct. That isn't the case. These "rules" imposed by the ideals of manhood have negative effects for women, LGBTQ + men, and straight men alike.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          First, I want to address how exaggerated masculinity promotes misogyny. When a man behaves in a certain way and other men perceive the behavior to be feminine or not manly, thus proceeding to mock the first man and act like he should feel like his behavior was wrong, they put women down. That kind of reaction implies that men should avoid coming off as womanly because women are inferior in that line of thinking. Phrases like "grow a pair" or "don't be such a pussy" need to go. They insinuate that cowardice is a trait attached to being a woman. This is similar to how saying that someone born with a penis (I'll get to that) should "be a real man" implies that to be anything else&#8212;for example, a woman&#8212;is weaker. It's incredibly unhealthy to experience that kind of pressure. I've even seen women exhibit this attitude as well, which is really ironic because it's bad for all womankind. There shouldn't be rules about what makes a man a man.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          I used the phrase "someone born with a penis" a few lines up. To clarify, I'm commenting on how it's important to keep in mind that not everyone with a penis is a man, and not everyone who doesn't have a penis is a woman; it's all about how you identify. A huge problem in the trans community is that trans people aren't accepted as "real" members of the gender with which they identify. We, as the younger generation, have to be more accepting. I'm not one of those people who thinks gender specific pronouns should be avoided, but I do think that if you find out someone isn't cisgender, you should use their preferred pronouns once you do know them. And if all these points are kept in mind, you'll never look shocked or otherwise alienate a genderqueer person should they come out to you.

                      <p>
                          Next, let's talk about the phrase "no homo". In our environment (and many others) the phrase itself is becoming a lot less accepted (although still used far too frequently), but it's clear that the sentiment is still present. It's the attitude that prevents boys from being able to say "I love you" to each other in an acting exercise. Even when the premise is that it's not real, uttering the words to another boy is too embarrassing. I shouldn't have to explain why that's a problem. First of all, you should love your friends. You should be able to hug your friends of your gender and tell them you love them without worrying about the implications. That's another thing: touch, between anyone, can be completely platonic. When one acts like it's a problem, one denies themselves the intimacy that they're allowed to have and that they should have. Secondly, it's offensive. It's not okay to act like being gay is shameful or makes someone any less of a man. Straight men are put under too much pressure to conform, to be some macho archetype, and to be "tough". It isn't healthy to worry about such things, nor is it healthy to make others worry about such things. Just be yourself, as cliche as it is, and stop worrying about what you're supposed to be. All it takes to be a man is to identify as one.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          Just remember that men come in many forms, have different interests, are attracted to different genders, and even have different sets of genitalia. There is no right or best way to be a man, so be respectful to every kind of man, and person for that matter, regardless of how traditionally "masculine" they are.

                              Can dead young men become old ghosts? There are three mosquito bites on my cheek, which means a dead man has kissed me goodnight three times today. I said goodbye to Baba long before I had a tongue or a hand, but he is not dead. I remember every man by itchy affection, each kiss leaving a swollen and hollow afterlife. You made a playground out of my body for children I do not have so I made a church blessed in your skin for a god living on the wrong side of the shore. Do you love me? Am I worth one more dollar? I don't remember what Baba looks like, but you remind me of him. Every man and his ghost are faceless. God is faceless, but He is the wrong God. And still I pray. I pray into you. An open mouth waiting for rain. What good is beauty that cannot speak for itself? Can you hear me now? The azaleas will find me. The grass from Ch&oacute;ng Q&igrave;ng will bring me home. They can hear us from here. Their roots slither toward the sound of trickling water like men slip into us. They know it does not belong to you. The sky will take back everything you stole from it, and return our waters to the right mother, godless and open, who gave our earth a home long before you had a mouth to moan with.
